# product-sample-images
Because Spoonflower needs a URL to add photos to a listing

to build a link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yolantis/product-sample-images/main/

links to my photos:

note to self 10/8/23. these links do not work with spoonflower. I cannot drag/drop product images in to their listing page nor can i link straight to a jpg online.
